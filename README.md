## 10 Key Scrum Terms
### Burndown Charts:
_Burndown charts are a good way to show what work you have remaining over time._

_The chart is broken down into the two axis - Y axis and X axis. The Y axis = Work remaining and X axis = Time._

_The work remaining should fluctuate and eventually decrease in amount._ 

### Daily Scrum Meeting:
A daily scrum meeting is a fifteen-minute meeting where each team member will answer three simple questions:

_1. "What have I done since the last Scrum meeting? (i.e. yesterday)"_

_2. "What will I do before the next Scrum meeting? (i.e. today)"_

_3. "What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?"_

The ScrumMaster will make sure that all members have sidebar meetings for any discussions that go too far outside of these constraints.

The Scrum literature recommends that these meetings take place first thing in the morning as soon as all team members are present.

### Impediments:
Anything that prevents a team member from performing work as efficiently as possible is an impediment.

Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. 

The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. 

ScrumMasters often arrange sidebar meetings when impediments cannot be resolved on the spot in the daily Scrum meeting.

### Product Backlog
Product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog items. 

While there are multiple inputs to the product backlog, it is the sole responsibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog.
