## 10 Key Scrum Terms
### Burndown Charts:
_Burndown charts are a good way to show what work you have remaining over time._

_The chart is broken down into the two axis - Y axis and X axis. The Y axis = Work remaining and X axis = Time._

_The work remaining should fluctuate and eventually decrease in amount._ 

### Daily Scrum Meeting:
A daily scrum meeting is a fifteen-minute meeting where each team member will answer three simple questions:

1. "What have I done since the last Scrum meeting? (i.e. yesterday)"

2. "What will I do before the next Scrum meeting? (i.e. today)"

3. "What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?"

The ScrumMaster will make sure that all members have sidebar meetings for any discussions that go too far outside of these constraints.

The Scrum literature recommends that these meetings take place first thing in the morning as soon as all team members are present.

### Impediments:
Anything that prevents a team member from performing work as efficiently as possible is an impediment.

Each team member has an opportunity to announce impediments during the daily Scrum meeting. 

The ScrumMaster is charged with ensuring impediments get resolved. 

ScrumMasters often arrange sidebar meetings when impediments cannot be resolved on the spot in the daily Scrum meeting.

### Product Backlog:
Product backlog is the requirements for a system, expressed as a prioritized list of product backlog items. 

While there are multiple inputs to the product backlog, it is the sole responsibility of the product owner to prioritize the product backlog.

### Product Owner Role:
In Scrum, a single person must have final authority representing the customer's interest in backlog prioritization and requirements questions.

This person must be available to the team at any time, but especially during the sprint planning meeting and the sprint review meeting.

Challenges of being a product owner:

- Resisting the temptation to "manage" the team. The team may not self-organize in the way you would expect it to. This is especially challenging if some team members request your intervention with issues the team should sort out for itself.

- Resisting the temptation to add more important work after a Sprint is already in progress.

- Being willing to make hard choices during the sprint planning meeting.

- Balancing the interests of competing stakeholders.

### Release Burnout Chart:
In Scrum, the release burndown chart is a "big picture" view of a release's progress. It shows how much work was left to do at the beginning of each sprint comprising a single release. The scope of this chart is a single release; however, a product burndown chart spans all releases.

### Scrum Roles:
There are three essential roles in any Scrum project:

1. Product Owner
2. ScrumMaster
3. Team

### ScrumMaster Role:
The ScrumMaster is a facilitator for the team and product owner. Rather than manage the team, the ScrumMaster works to assist both the team and product owner in the following ways:

- Remove the barriers between the development and the product owner so that the product owner directly drives development.
- Teach the product owner how to maximize return on investment (ROI), and meet his/her objectives through Scrum.
- Improve the lives of the development team by facilitating creativity and empowerment.
- Improve the productivity of the development team in any way possible.
- Improve the engineering practices and tools so that each increment of functionality is potentially shippable.
- Keep information about the team's progress up to date and visible to all parties.

### Sprint:
An iteration of work during which an increment of product functionality is implemented. By the book, an iteration lasts 30 days. This is longer than in other agile methods to take into account the fact that a functional increment of product must be produced each sprint.

The sprint starts with a one-day sprint planning meeting. Many daily Scrum meetings occur during the sprint (one per day). At the end of the sprint we have a sprint review meeting, followed by a sprint retrospective meeting.

During the sprint, the team must not be interrupted with additional requests. Guaranteeing the team won't be interrupted allows it to make real commitments it can be expected to keep.

### Team:
A team (or "Scrum team") is optimally comprised of seven plus or minus two people.

For software development projects, the team members are usually a mix of software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, QA experts, testers, UI designers, etc. This is often called "cross-functional project teams". Agile practices also encourage cross-functional team members.

During a sprint, the team self-organizes to meet the sprint goals. The team has autonomy to choose how to best meet the goals, and is held responsible for them. The ScrumMaster acts as a guardian to ensure that the team is insulated from the product owner.

### Velocity:
In Scrum, velocity is how much product backlog effort a team can handle in one sprint. This can be estimated by viewing previous sprints, assuming the team composition and sprint duration are kept constant. It can also be established on a sprint-by-sprint basis, using commitment-based planning.

Once established, velocity can be used to plan projects and forecast release and product completion dates.

How can velocity computations be meaningful when backlog item estimates are intentionally rough? The law of large numbers tends to average out the roughness of the estimates.
## Other Terms:
### Algorithm
An algorithm is a list of rules to follow in order to solve a problem. Algorithms can perform calculations, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.
### Procedural
Relating to an established or official way of doing something. 
### Pseudocode
A detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do. Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.
### Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within the program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.
### Coding Standards
Guideline for specific languages, e.g. Indentations, variable names, comments
### API
In computer programming, an application programming interface is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software.
### Programming paradigm
Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
### Procedural programming paradigm
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
## Some Common Paradigms:
### Imperative: 
Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
### Declarative: 
Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
### Structured: 
Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.
### Procedural: 
Imperative programming with procedure calls.
### Functional (Applicative): 
Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
### Function-Level (Combinator): 
Programming with no variables at all.
### Object-Oriented: 
Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. Object orientation can be:
* Class-based: Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.
* Prototype-based: Objects get behavior from a prototype object.
### Event-Driven: 
Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.
### Flow-Driven: 
Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.
### Logic (Rule-based): 
Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.
### Constraint: 
Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.
### Aspect-Oriented: 
Programming cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.
### Reflective: 
Programming by manipulating the program elements themselves.
### Array: 
Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.
### Programming steps:
## 1.	Clarify/Define the Language and IDE:
You will want to start by selecting a programming language to use, this is the language that you will write your project in. each language is different so it is important you select the right one for what you need. You will then want to chose an IDE to use, an IDE is a program or area where you will write your code. Some IDE's will have a debugging feature and possibly a preview of the code so that you can get a live view of what you're making.
## 2.	Design the Program:
Within the design process you will need to create certain design documentation to help you with the project. The first thing that you will need to start with will be a flow chart, this will help you to make a step by step guide to how your code works. The second will be storyboards, this will help you turn your ideas into actual designs. You can then use your flow chart to help you map your storyboard, it helps by showing you which steps will go one after the other.
## 3.	Code the Program:
In this stage, you will be using the IDE that you selected earlier and the language you chose to start your code. You will make sure at this stage that everything you plan to do is right for the clients needs. You will use the flow chart from your design documentation to help make sure that you are following the correct steps for your code.
## 4.	Test the Program:
Throughout the coding process you will need to run regualr tests to make sure that the code you're typing is correct or that it works, if you have a good IDE then it will usually advise you if there are mistakes or problems with your code, however if this is not the case then you will need to find alternate ways to troubleshoot the code. This can be done by running the code as intended e.g. opening it in a browser or even in a third party software/program to see if the correct features load.
## 5.	Document and Maintain:
Throughout the process of creating your working program for a client you should be documenting everything so that if they ask for evidence or you need to go back and see where you went wrong you will be able too. Documentation also helps to provide evidence to the client to show how hard or how long you spent working on the project.
### Use Case:
In software and systems engineering, a use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system.
### Class Diagram:
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.
