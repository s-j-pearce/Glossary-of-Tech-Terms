### Burndown Charts:
_Burndown charts are a good way to show what work you have remaining over time._

_The chart is broken down into the two axis - Y axis and X axis. The Y axis = Work remaining and X axis = Time._

_The work remaining should fluctuate and eventually decrease in amount._ 

### Daily Scrum Meeting:
A daily scrum meeting is a fifteen-minute meeting where each team member will answer three simple questions:

_1. "What have I done since the last Scrum meeting? (i.e. yesterday)"_

_2. "What will I do before the next Scrum meeting? (i.e. today)"_

_3. "What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?"_
